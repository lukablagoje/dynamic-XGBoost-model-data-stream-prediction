    "Hi @joseantonioalatorre, yes the train and test dates are continuous as you describe. Train set date ids are 0-480, test ids start from 481 and are a 2.5 month (approx) continuous set starting immediately after the end of the training set."

The test dataset has the exact same structure as the train data. The api will return the test data sequentially, so you will be able to use rolling features etc…\n",
